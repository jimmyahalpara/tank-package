# tank-package
my another great and interesting game made using python, and pygame.
controls are fairly simple, a,d for left and right movement, w,s, for changing barrel angle. and space to fire bullets and m to fire guides missiles
bullets and missiles are limited, so use it wisely. 
you will find two bars at the bottom of the screen, first from the left is health bar, dont let it go down and second one is barrel heat 
which will increase when you fire bullet, dont let it go up or else you will die.
if .exe file dont works then try to use compiled python file .pyc (if u have python installed).
intresting feature is guided missile will make decision on its own. hope you will enjoy.
